Barely a catworld mud client, using mithril.js


# TODO

* emap
* message window
* stats window
* proper IAC response
  * sync_time ticking
  * init IAC do/will repsponse
* mxp support
* scrollback lock
* reverse commands search
* inifinite scrolling ( doesn't really need to be infinite, but a larger scroll back buffer with fine performance would be nice right? )

# DONE
